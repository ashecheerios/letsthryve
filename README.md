# Let's Thryve

Let's Thryve is a Facebook Messenger bot that can help people find friends that want to exercise or hangout together. It also helps users broadcast their personal wellness goals so that they can work towards them together with their friends. Below are some screenshots.

Let's Thryve is hosted on DigitalOcean and you can find the Facebook Page at [https://facebook.com/letsthryve](https://facebook.com/letsthryve). Just chat with the bot to get started (note: you have to be a developer to chat with the bot since it hasn't been released yet).

More screenshots in the future.
